Back from a haitus due to other working conditions,

getting back to creating my landing page.
decided to only work from the top down, so today i did the header and all though im not 100% happy with the placement of everything i am happy with my progress today.

i had to re-learn some things but once i got into the flow alot of things came back to me like second nature,still alot to learn though and getting there.

Tomrrow i will touch up and finalise My header+hero and then move towards the first section of the Body.
